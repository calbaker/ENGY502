# %%
# imports

# import fastsim

# build SimDriveLabel object for battery electric vehicle (BEV)

# find optimum battery and motor size subject to 0-60 mph constraint of 10 s and a fixed cost + linear cost per energy and power, respectively

## Via plotting

## Via scipy optimize

# Plot time traces of selected design

# Open-ended question: what are pros/cons of using plotting compared to scipy optimize?
